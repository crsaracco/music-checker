# Music Checker

My typical project when I'm learning a new language.

This program will check your music collection against the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) database, and will tell you if you're missing any releases. It's useful for keeping up-to-date with your favorite artists to make sure you don't miss anything new.

For now, your "collection" is just some metadata inside a sqlite database, and the user has to manually add artists and confirm/ignore releases via sqlite. Maybe I'll write some interface through the rust program eventually.
